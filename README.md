# Summer_Project_2022
This project is based on the course project CEE201: Systems Engrg &amp; Economics, guided by Professor Eleftheria Kontou. It provides code templates to solve classic transportation problems, like shortest path,transshipment problems, traveling salesperson problems, and etc. 

**Pulp** and **NetworkX** are two packages used in the project to build the transportation networks and solve classis transportation problems. 
In each template, concept of each problem is defined and two different methods to solve the problem are proposed.

The basic knowledge of using networkX is obtained by the reference of "Introduction to NetworkX".It provides detailed instruction on how to build the network and how to utilize different functions to analyze typical problems and visualize the network solutions. http://avinashu.com/tutorial/pythontutorial/NetworkXBasics.html
